												Hello there! I'm José Vieira and I'm a huge videogame fan!
												<br>I love making AI behavior and engaging in the design process of the enemies, as well as buddy AI systems. Really enjoy delving into 3Cs as well, especially tight/responsive movement systems and combat abilities! I'm always up to take on a hard challenge, contributing with what I know and learning what I don't know to get a game up and running, everything I can do to have something I'm proud of in my hands!
											</p>
											<p>
												Games have always been my biggest passion and my creative fuel. Been playing since my parents gave me a copy of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> when I was a little kid!
												In my free time (apart from obviously playing games), I like to develop small game prototypes, collecting swords, go for a good run, and maybe rewatch <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (it never gets old)!

																<h3><b>AI</b></h3>
																<li><b>Sea Monsters</b> - Developed the tech framework for sea monsters, including decision‑making using a HSM, data‑driven attacks with animation integration, attack windows, hit reactions, etc...</li>
																<li><b>Environment Query System</b> - Contributed to the implementation of a spatial awareness system used by the AI agents to query the environment in order to find the best position for it to move.</li>
																<li><b>Archetype Behaviors</b> - Implemented different ship archetypes using Behavior Trees (e.g. guarding ships; ships targeting the player's side; ...).</li>
																<li><b>Utility AI</b> - Used to decide on the high level behaviors of the agents (e.g. in combat; out of combat; fleeing; ...).</li>
																<li><b>AI Proxy</b> - Created simple proxy objects representing the agents for when they are out of the player's loading range, allowing them to simulate some simple behaviors and keep some state while very far away from the player, saving computational costs.</li>
																<li><b>Threat System</b> - Contributed to a system that tracks all entities that are in combat with an agent and how much threat they each pose, allowing to make decisions based on the threat each pose (e.g. attacking the entity that the agent considers more threatening; attacking the least threatening entity first to focus on the others later).</li>
																<li><b>Attack Ticket System</b> - Contributed to a system that gives out tickets allowing agents to attack other agents or players (e.g. only allow 4 attack tickets to be given to agents targeting the player, so that the player never gets too overwhelmed).</li>

																<br><h3><b>Narrative</b></h3>
																<li><b>Dialogue & Story Controller</b> - Implemented a fully event-driven, time-sliced dialogue controller for the game's narrative, supporting concurrent dialogues for both land and sea. This system is able to analyse the state of the game and decide which dialogue scene it should play.<!--After doing a performance pass, I improved the system's performance by nearly 60%.--></li> <!----Need to talk more about this one.-->
																<li><b>Sound Matching Lip Sync</b> - Integrated lip syncing technology in the engine, handling the logic for the lip's movements and integrating it into the animation graph.</li>
																<li><b>Remember Player-Actions System</b> - Implemented a system that keeps track of dozens of player actions, allowing characters to respond to those same actions (e.g. player defeated an enemy with a specific weapon, so some characters might react to that when the player talks to them).</li>
																<li><b>Dialogue Editor</b> - Supported and extended a tool for the creation of dialogue scenes.</li>
																<li>Created debug tools using ImGui.</li>
																<li>Worked with Technical Animators in the Animation Graph.</li>
																<li>Autonomously drove features forward, actively reaching out to designers and producers to keep things on track.</li>

															<ul>
																<li><b>Heat Mechanic</b> - Player has to carry a bomb-like item and shield it from the sun, otherwise it overheats and explodes.
																<br>→ Used periodic raycasts to detect line-of-sight with the sun.
																<br>→ Cached closed-by bushes to verify if the player was inside them using collision detection.
																<br>→ Built water objects to cool the bomb (e.g. sprinkle that can be turned on/off; water park mushroom; water sink that can be interacted with).
																<li><b>Player Lives</b> - Implemented an arcade "player lives" feature for the Special Operations game mode, where players have a limited number of times they can die before failing the mission. Required integration with the normal quest flow and UI elements.</li>
																<li><b>Interaction System</b> - Improvements on the interaction system, creating different scoring profiles for new gameplay functionalities (e.g. interacting with teammate; picking up a bomb).</li>
																<li><b>Networking</b> - Wrote multiplayer code for the gameplay systems I was in charge of.</li>
																<li><b>Animations</b> - Worked with animators to link animations to gameplay systems.</li>
																<li>Exposed C++ functionalities to blueprint nodes through LUA, used by quest and technical designers.</li>

										<h2>Skills</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Behavior Trees</h3>
											<p>Very experienced with them. I’ve implemented different AI Archetypes in Skull and Bones using BTs and a variety of decorators, composite nodes, sub‑trees and the like. Also used them while working on Ganbatte, and I’ve written my own Behavior Tree plugin for the Unity engine, which gives me a good understanding of how to use them but also how they actually work in code.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Environment Query System</h3>
											<p>Very experienced with EQS. I’ve expanded the technology in ”007 First Light” with more generators, filters and evaluators. Used it in Skull and Bones for sea monster and ship position selection (e.g. keeping an enemy ship at the back of the player’s ship; keep an enemy ship in a position where it’s close to its allies but blocking the line of sight from the player to the allies; etc). I’ve also used it in Unreal Engine for small prototypes (e.g. simulating Final Fantasy XV AI buddy position philosophy, where the agents stay at the front of the player’s direction and in the camera view while roaming in the world).</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Pathfinding & Navigation</h3>
											<p>I’ve implemented pathfinding algorithms like A* (e.g. in a project where many agents are placed in a room with fog of war, with the goal of finding the room exit and informing the other agents where the exit is). In ”007 First Light”, worked on generating paths with Navigation Links and coded how the agents use said links, with animation integration. Also implemented Dijkstra algorithm for a GPS app that lets users see the shortest path from a starting to an ending location.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Hierarchical and Finite State Machines</h3>
											<p>Experienced with both HSM and FSM for controlling AI agents, for the player controller, and for animation graphs. I’ve used HSM in Skull and Bones for sea monsters, and on Far Cry 6 for the player controller state machine (for hierarchical states like Ground/GroundMove/GoundSliding).</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>3D Math</h3>
											<p>Programmed numerous gameplay features that required mathematical concepts, like enemy perception (vision and hearing), stealth cover system, hover car vehicle, evaluators for environmental spatial queries, etc...</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Code Architecture and Design Patterns</h3>
											<p>I thoroughly enjoy designing new gameplay systems from scratch and coming up with a good architecture to make it as efficiently designed and data-driven as possible, using design patterns whenever possible. Allowing designers to create different gameplay scenarios just by manipulating data is something I always strive for.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Animation Graphs</h3>
											<p>Experience working with Animation Graphs, like defining the different animation state machines and their transitions, making use of additive animations, as well as blending between different ones. This is an aspect of game development I find very rewarding, it's a bridge between tech and art where the character comes alive!</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Networking</h3>
											<p>I’ve used techniques like client‑side prediction, server reconciliation and entity interpolation for the Unstatic project. I also have experience working with replication models in AAA games and personal projects</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Debugging</h3>
											<p>Tracking bugs with the help of data breakpoints and memory changes, making good use of the callstack and the watch window, and loading in dump files when a crash happens can help with pinpointing the issue and fixing it ASAP.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Others</h3>
											<p>Languages: C++, C#, C, Javascript.
												<br>Engines: Unreal Engine 4, Unity and other AAA proprietary engine technologies.
												<br>Version Control Software: Perforce, Git.
